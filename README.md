# My Awesome Project
A Haitian Food Cuisine Menu .
Update an Order, update the fish on the Menu, update the Inventory and even change stores while having the ability to store the data that was already entered in a different store!
REACT is awesome!!!!
I learned to use keys to store values in localStorage, and new ES6 syntax/magic in order to cut down on code when retrieving the value from an input!


## How It's Made:
This application is made with React.
